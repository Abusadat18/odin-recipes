    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached
      egg. Basted eggs are fried on the bottom and steamed on top. They look
      similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly more set.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      Steps
    </ol>
    <li>
      Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack
      eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1
      minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to
      medium-low.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white
      has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a
      serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve
      immediately.
